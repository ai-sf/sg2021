  title: "Technology transfer: how to bring laboratory research to the market"
  bio: "FM is Full Professor of Physics of Matter at the Department of Materials Science of the Milano-Bicocca state-University. After his degree in Physics at the University of Milano, he earned in 1995 a post-degree specialization in “Material Science and Technology”. Then, he received several post-Doc research fellows by, among the others, Alenia Space (1996-1997) and by the National Institute for the Physics of Matter (1998). In 1999 he obtained the position of Assistant Professor in Experimental Physics at the Milano-Bicocca University and in 2005 that of Associate Professor of Physics of Matter. FM published more than 200 papers on international journals which received more that 8000 citations resulting in a H-Index of 51. FM research activity is focused on the photophysics and electronic properties of organic and hybrid materials. Main research topics deals with: cooperative effects in organic semiconductors, photophysics of conjugated oligomers, host-guest compound, organolanthanides complexes, colloidal nanoparticles and photon managing processes for solar applications. During his research activity, he worked also on inorganic materials for optoelectronic (silica-based glasses, and scintillating glasses/crystals) and microelectronic (titanium disilicide). The main recent achievements concern the up-conversion of the solar radiation by using properly designed plastic multicomponent systems, and the development of a new generation of luminescent solar concentrators for building integrated photovoltaic systems. In 2016, with the support of a pool investors, FM founded the company Glass to Power and becomes its chairman. At the end of 2020 the company employs 10 people and has already raised over 3.5 million Euros in funding from private investors as well as about 1.5 million from projects funded by public bodies."
  abstract: "Turning academic research into a product for real world applications is a difficult but very rewarding challenge that requires both scientific skills and entrepreneurial spirit. This talk will review the steps taken to transform a proof of concept about the manipulation of nanomaterials to give them unconventional properties, into a transparent photovoltaic device that can be integrated without any aesthetic impact in energy-sustainable buildings. This is exactly the story of the spin-off Glass to Power which, starting from some innovative ideas and patents, has recently arrived to install its first prototypes and is now ready for entering the market of the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV)."

  title: "Measuring the Gravitational constant with atom interferometry for fundamental physics test"
  bio: "Nato a Firenze il 1 Marzo 1984 si laurea di Fisica e Astofisica nel 2008 presso Università degli studi di Firenze e consegue il dottorato in Fisica Applicata presso Università di Pisa nel 2012. Nel 2015 prende servizio come ricercatore presso la sezione INFN di Firenze. Dal 2009 si occupa di misure di gravità di precisione utilizzando atomi freddi in caduta, e più in particolare alla misura della costante di Gravitazione Universale."
  abstract: "Starting from the original experiment performed by Henry Cavendish more than two centuries ago, the precision determination of the gravitational constant G remains a challenging endeavor. It has been measured about a dozen times over the last 50 years, but the results have varied much more than what would be expected from random and systematic errors. Likely, this is due to the fact that, so far, all the past experiments have relied on macroscopic classical instruments, which could all be governed by uncontrolled mechanical influences. On the other hand, a recent controversial study about correlations between the measured values of G and the variations of the length of day seems to suggest that some other not well-understood effects could be present. The MEGANTE experiment will address all these issues by carrying out precision G determinations making use of original experimental strategies based on quantum sensors. Unprecedented accuracy levels will be achieved using cold atoms in free-fall to probe the gravitational field, surpassing thus the state-of-art measurements based on torsion balance and simple pendulum. In parallel, MEGANTE will provide results that go far beyond the pure metrological interest. Indeed, owing the lack of a full understanding of gravity, several theoretical models predict new physics phenomena such violations of the inverse square law or a dependency of the G value from the local density of the matter."
